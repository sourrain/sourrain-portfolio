# @prismicio/vue V₂

> Vue.js plugin to facilitate integration of content managed with [Prismic.io](https://prismic.io).
Looking for a Nuxt solution? Here you go 👉 [@nuxtjs/prismic plugin](https://github.com/nuxt-community/prismic)

# Install

⚠️ We've moved `prismic-vue` to `@prismicio/vue`. You can safely replace the former with the latter to your node modules ✌️

`@prismic/vue` relies on `prismic-javascript` and `prismic-dom`.
If you are migrating from V1, make sure to install them too as they are now peer dependencies.
``` bash
npm install @prismicio/vue prismic-javascript prismic-dom
```
👉 quick note: prismic-javascript is a library responsible for _making requests to your Prismic endpoint_,
while prismic-dom is responsible for serializing html from RichText ([RichText you said?](https://user-guides.prismic.io/en/articles/383762-rich-text)).

# What it does

This package serves two purposes and can actually be split into two different parts.

#### 1- Queries
The first purpose of `@prismicio/vue` is to offer an easy way to fetch your Prismic content. When registering `PrismicVue`, we directly inject a `prismic-javascript` instance, to be used anywhere in your Vue project.

``` javascript
import prismicJS from 'prismic-js';

const PrismicVue = {
  install: function (Vue, options) {
    Vue.prototype.$prismic = prismicJS
    Vue.prototype.$prismic.endpoint = options.endpoint
    Vue.prototype.$prismic.linkResolver = options.linkResolver
    Vue.prototype.$prismic.client = prismicJS.client(options.endpoint, options.apiOptions)
    ...
  }
}
```

### 2 - Components

The second purpose of `@prismicio/vue` is to globally register components that will help you _display content queried via your Prismic API_. Their purpose is (mostly) to serialize Prismic data into html. These components being used in other libraries (like `@nuxtjs/prissmic`), note that you can actually import them without registering `PrismicVue`.


# Usage

This [getting started guide](https://prismic.io/docs/vuejs/getting-started/integrating-with-existing-project) should be of great help to kickstart your first Prismic/Vue project.
In case you're more into markdown, you can alternatevely keep reading ☺️

### 1/Register PrismicVue
First, you should register the plugin:
```javascript
import PrismicVue from '@prismicio/vue'

Vue.use(PrismicVue, {
  endpoint: 'https://your-api-endpoint.prismic.io/api/v2',
  linkResolver: function(doc) {
    if (doc.type === 'home') {
        return '/';
    }
  },
});
```

When registering the plugin, you may pass these options. Although `linkResolver` and `htmlSerializer` are not required, they are usually pretty useful. Make sure to check them out! ✌️


| Option name    	| Type     	| Required 	| Default value 	| Description                                                                                                          	|
|----------------	|----------	|----------	|---------------	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| endpoint       	| string   	| yes      	| none          	| Your Prismic api endpoint                                                                                            	|
| linkResolver   	| function 	| no       	| none          	| See [Link Resolving in Javascript](https://prismic.io/docs/javascript/beyond-the-api/link-resolving)                 	|
| htmlSerializer 	| function 	| no       	| none          	| See [html Serializer documentation](https://prismic.io/docs/javascript/beyond-the-api/html-serializer)               	|
| linkType       	| string   	| no       	| vueRouter     	| Link components may be handled differently based on what you use. Currently accepted values: 'vueRouter' and 'nuxt'. 	|

### 2/Query your content
Because we inject a `prismic-javascript` instance into Vue, each of its method are accessible from your components. Make sure to check [its documentation](https://github.com/prismicio/prismic-javascript)!

A bare bone example that fetches data from a `home` document and then sets a `fields` data object:
```javascript
export default {
  name: 'MyComponent',
  data() {
    return {
      fields: {
        title: null,
        logo: null,
        somethingRich: null
      }
    }
  },
  methods: {
    getContent () {
      this.$prismic.client.getSingle('home')
        .then((document) => {
          this.fields = document.data
        })
    }
  },
  created () {
    this.getContent();
  }
}
```

### 3/use components
Following the example above, let's write the associated template:

```html
<template>
  <section>
    <prismic-image :field="fields.logo" />
    <prismic-rich-text :field="fields.title" />
    <prismic-rich-text :field="fields.somethingRich" />
  </section>
</template>
```

👆 If you were to log `document.data` in our previous query, you would notice that `title` and `somethingRich` are actually arrays instead of strings. This is because Prismic provides content writers with a WYSIWYG editor. It's awesome for formatting text but harder to deal with on client side. Fortunately, `prismic-rich-text` is a component made to deal with this format.

Obviously, `prismic-image` works the same way on image fields, stored in your Prismic API.

# List of components

List of available components and use cases:


| Component         	| Prismic type      	| Use case                                                         	| Example use                                                                                         	|
|-------------------	|-------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| prismic-rich-text 	| Rich Text, Title 	| Used when you need formatting fir text (bold, italic, embeds...) 	| `<prismic-rich-text :field="field.description" wrapper="div" :htmlSerializer="myLocalSerializer"/>` 	|
| prismic-link      	| Link              	| Used to resolve links stored in your Prismic content.            	| `<prismic-link :field="menuLink.link">My link</prismic-link>`                                       	|
| prismic-image     	| Image             	| Used to display images stored in Prismic.                        	| `<prismic-image :field="fields.logo" />`                                                            	|
| prismic-embed     	| Embed             	| Used to display embeds stored in Prismic.                        	| `<prismic-embed :field="fields.embed" wrapper="div" />`                                             	|

👆 Make sure to have a look at their source code: it is quite short, does simple things and might help you understand how we convert a Prismic API response into something that can actually be committed to the DOM.

# Integrate @prismicio/vue components

If you are working on a `@prismicio/vue` integration (like Nuxt does for example), you might find the need to use the components, without using the actual `PrismicVue` plugin. We've got you covered:

```javascript
import { common, vueRouter, nuxt } from '@prismicio/vue/components';

console.log(common) // { Embed, Image, RichText ...}
console.log(nuxt) // { Link }
// etc.

Vue.prototype.$prismic = {
  // because some components
  // require a link resolver
  linkResolver() { /* ... */}
}

// Register common components
Object.entries(common).forEach(([_, component]) => {
    Vue.component(component.name, component)
})
```
